Spring Boot Money Transfer API

Introduction
This project is aimed at demonstrating my eagerness to learn and showcase my skills as an entry-level developer. Despite being new to the field and and knowing that I have no experience in the subject, I have put in effort to build a  RESTful API for transferring money between two accounts.

Project Overview
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective RESTful API that facilitates financial transactions between two bank accounts. 
The API adheres to certain acceptance criteria, ensuring proper handling of scenarios such as successful money transfers, insufficient balances, transfer between the same account, and non-existent accounts.

1)Java(IntelliJ IDEA): The project is built using the Java programming language.
2)Spring Boot: I utilized the Spring Boot framework to simplify the development of the RESTful API.
